-------------------------

### How to:
- `make run-test-%app_name_here%` - to build images and run application tests
- `make run-test-flask` - is only available here. All available modules located [here](https://github.com/and-blk/PythonTests/tree/main/tests/agents).
Naming convention should be the same for any new application.
